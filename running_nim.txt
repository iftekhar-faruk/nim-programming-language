The code for a simple hello world program is as follows:

echo "Hello World"

Save this text as helloworld.nim. To compile and execute the program, the following command should be run

nim c -r --verbosity:0 helloworld.nim
Hello World

The command has several elements:

    c is an alias for compile, which compiles the Nim sources into C and then invokes the C compiler on them
    -r is an alias for --run, which runs the program
    --verbosity:0 makes the compiler only output essential messages, since by default it also outputs some debugging messages. From now on, we assume that --verbosity:0 is set
    ./helloworld.nim is the path to the source you want to compile


In the terminal we can write:
> nim c first.nim
Then,
> ./first

The following command compile and run the program
> nim -r c first.nim

> nim r first.nim

> nim r --verbosity:0 --hints:off first.nim
